# CampusNova

University campuses often lack a centralized, accessible digital hub where students, faculty, and administration can seamlessly interact, access academic resources, track progress, and stay informed about campus life. 
CampusNova is a web-based platform that integrates academic, administrative, and social services into one accessible, user-friendly system. It empowers students, faculty, and staff by simplifying campus life and enhancing communication, learning, and peer-to-peer interaction.
